"""
tgext.menu is a tool to allow the web developer to specify where a given
method should appear in the menu hierarchy without having to deal with
templates. For how to use this, please see the README file. As this is geared
towards developers, the README file is the complete reference.

# The below code is a bit of magic to make the usage of tgext.menu easier on
# the developer. Basically, it grabs the current variable_provider from the
# config, puts the tgext.menu variable provider into the config, and then
# returns the results from its own plus the original variable provider.
#
# By doing this, the developer does not have to remember to update the
# variable provider to provide the functions that the README says should be
# available in all templates.
