== Welcome to the TurboGears Menu Extension ==

tgext.menu provides a way for controllers to be more easily reused,
while providing developers a way to stop worrying about the menus in
their application. In a nutshell, that is what you get.

One thing that all web applications have in common is the need for
menus to help users navigate the application. The menus can be small,
single level, easily displayed across the top of the page. Or they can
be large, complex, hierarchical, and highly variable depending on
permissions and a whole host of other factors. tgext.menu helps out in
any of these cases.


When you use tgext.menu, you need to do the following three steps:

1. Add it to your project. This is accomplished by modifying your setup.py. Add "tgext.menu" to your **install_requires** list. 

2. Add it to your master template. This step varies depending on whether you are using Mako or Genshi for your templating engine. In either case, where you have the code to render your navigation bar, put this code:

**Mako**

{{{
#!html+mako
${render_navbar()|n}
}}}

**Genshi**

Place this near the top of your template:
{{{
#!genshi
<?python
from genshi import HTML
?>
}}}

And place this where your navigation bar would go.
{{{
#!genshi
${HTML(render_navbar(True))}
}}}

3. Add tgext.menu into your controllers. Place this code in any controllers that will be using tgext.menu:

{{{
#!python
from tgext.menu import navbar, sidebar, menu
}}}

In front of any @expose'd methods, place a call to add them to your navigation bar, like so:

{{{
#!python
@navbar('TestHome')
@expose('genshi:tgext.menu.test.templates.index')
def index(self, *p, **kw):
    return dict()
}}}

To nest menus, use || as separators, like so:

{{{
#!python
@navbar('My || Sub || Menu')
@expose('genshi:tgext.menu.test.templates.index')
def index(self, *p, **kw):
    return dict()
}}}


And that's it, your menus will now render automatically. When you
addmore items to your navbar using @navbar, they will appear without
your having to update any templates at all.

== Full Documentation ==

tgext.menu is built around the idea that a given web application can
have any number of menus. In this extension, each of them are
named. Two are so common that they are given shortcuts in the API:
navbar and sidebar. If you have other menus you wish to add to, you
will need to name them specifically. Fortunately, this is not as hard
as it sounds.


In your controller code, you will be using one of three methods:

* @navbar('menu path')
* @sidebar('menu path')
* @menu('menu path', 'menu name')

menu path is simply a string of entries, separated by ||, indicating
where this particular entry lives in the menu hierarchy. An example
would be "Help || About" or "Edit || Copy", or "My || Deeply || Nested
|| Submenu". Spaces around || will be stripped off, and are only put
in those strings for readability.

If you use the @menu decorator, you will need to specify which menu
this particular menu entry belongs to. This will allow you to provide
a specific menu for a specific section of your application. An example
would be if you are writing up an admin module, and want to provide an
admin-only menu.

Using @menu will be rare. Normally, you will only be using @navbar or
@sidebar.

In your template, you will need to render the menu. This follows a
similar pattern from above. You will have the following methods
available to you in your template:

* render_navbar(vertical=False)
* render_sidebar(vertical=False)
* render_menu(menu_name, vertical=False)

The "vertical" parameter is used to tell jdMenu that this should be a vertical
menu.

In your app_cfg, you may have a section named "base_config.tgext_menu". The
way to add this section is to produce code like this:

    base_config.tgext_menu = {}
    base_config.tgext_menu['inject_css'] = True

This has two possible parameters in it: inject_css and sortorder.

The "inject_css" parameter is used to inject the default CSS that
comes from the [[http://jdsharp.us/jQuery/plugins/jdMenu/|jdMenu
plugin]]. It is set to False,by default, so as to allow you to specify
your own CSS.

"sortorder" is a bit more complex to explain. Basically, using this, you can
set up the sort ordering for your menus. This is done by assigning entries a
numeric value, with higher values going towards the right/bottom, and lower
values towards the left/top. An entry is a single path segment. This is
accomplished by assigning a dictionary to the sortorder configuration
paramter. Unassigned entries will be given a value of 999999. All of this is
best to explain by example.

Assume we have the following menu entries:
ExitApp
Foo Spot || Bar
Foo Spot || Baz
Foo Spot || Foo

Now assume we have set the following dictionary as our sort order:
{ 'ExitApp': 20, 'Foo': 10 }

This will result in the menus being order like so:
ExitApp
Foo Spot || Foo
Foo Spot || Bar
Foo Spot || Baz

'ExitApp' will be compared with 'Foo Spot'. 'Foo Spot' has the value 999999,
and ExitApp has 20. ExitApp goes first.

In the sub menu for 'Foo Spot', 'Foo' has the value 10, while the others have
the value 999999. 'Foo' goes first.

== Drawbacks ==

As of right now, the menus are alphabetically sorted. This will be
fixed in the next release, allowing you to specify the ordering of the
menu entries.

Permissions are not yet honored: Any entries will always show up for
all users. This, too, will be fixed in the next release.

Dynamic menu entries are possible right now, but not easy. A future
release will provide support for menu_append and menu_remove methods.
